# MUI Imports Rule

## Avoid Barrel Imports for @mui

To optimize bundle size and improve tree-shaking, always import MUI components from their specific paths instead of using barrel imports.

### ❌ Bad - Barrel Imports

```typescript
import { Button, TextField } from "@mui/material";
import { DataGrid } from "@mui/x-data-grid";
```

### ✅ Good - Direct Imports

```typescript
import Button from "@mui/material/Button";
import TextField from "@mui/material/TextField";
import { DataGrid } from "@mui/x-data-grid";
```

## Why?

Barrel imports (importing multiple components from the main package entry point) can:

- Increase bundle size by including unnecessary code
- Reduce the effectiveness of tree-shaking
- Slow down build times

Direct imports ensure that only the specific component code is included in your bundle.

## Applies to:

- `@mui/material`
- `@mui/icons-material`
- `@mui/lab`
- Other `@mui/*` packages
