# Project Architecture

## Folder Structure Guidelines

### General rules

- For a feature | domain-layer do not create global index.ts file, exporting components, utils, hooks
- Don't create index.ts files with exports on a root feature | layer level

### Feature-Based Development (`src/features/`)

**When creating a new feature**, generate a new folder under `src/features/` with the following structure:

```
src/features/
  └── my-new-feature/
      ├── components/
      ├── utils/
      └── hooks/
```

**Examples of features:**

- `chat/` - Chat interface functionality
- `file-upload/` - File upload feature
- `notifications/` - Notification system
- `split-view-mode/` - Split view UI feature

**Use features for:**

- UI-specific functionality
- User-facing features
- Page-level components
- Application-specific logic

---

### Core Domain Logic (`src/domain/`)

**For core business logic**, place files into `src/domain/` with the following structure:

```
src/domain/
  └── my-domain/
      ├── components/
      ├── utils/
      └── hooks/
```

**Examples of domain logic:**

- `auth/` - Authentication business logic
- `user/` - User management core logic
- `messages/` - Message handling domain logic
- `locale/` - Localization logic
- `theme/` - Theme management

**Use domain for:**

- Reusable business logic
- Core state management
- Domain models and types
- Cross-feature shared logic
- API integrations

## Decision Guide

### Choose `features/` when:

- Building a user-facing feature
- Creating page-specific functionality
- Implementing UI-specific behavior
- Feature is isolated to specific user workflows

### Choose `domain/` when:

- Implementing core business rules
- Creating reusable utilities
- Managing shared state
- Building cross-feature functionality
- Defining domain models
