# Animations Guidelines

## Keep your animations fast

- Animations should never be longer than 1s (unless it's illustrative), most of them should be much shorter.
- Default to use ease-out for most animations for natural motion.
- Keep micro-interactions under 200ms for immediate feedback.

## Easing rules

- Don't use built-in CSS easings unless it's `ease` or `linear`.

## Animation Library Guidelines

### Use Framer Motion for complex animations

- **When to use Framer Motion**:

  - Complex multi-step animations
  - Gesture-based interactions (drag, swipe, pinch)
  - Layout animations with shared elements
  - Physics-based animations (spring, bounce)
  - Staggered animations for lists or grids
  - Page transitions and route animations

- **When to use CSS animations**:
  - Simple hover states
  - Basic fade in/out effects
  - Loading spinners
  - Simple transforms (scale, rotate)

### Framer Motion Best Practices

- Use `motion` components for animated elements
- Leverage `variants` for complex state management
- Use `AnimatePresence` for enter/exit animations
- Prefer `spring` animations for natural motion
- Use `layout` prop for automatic layout animations
- Keep animations performant with `will-change` CSS property

Import motion from:
`import { motion } from "motion/react"`

## Performance Considerations

- Use `transform` and `opacity` properties for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Avoid animating `width`, `height`, `top`, `left` properties
- Use `will-change` sparingly and remove it after animation completes
- Consider `prefers-reduced-motion` for accessibility
- Test animations on lower-end devices

## Accessibility

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` user preference
- Provide alternative feedback for users who can't see animations
- Ensure animations don't cause vestibular disorders
- Use `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` to disable animations when needed
